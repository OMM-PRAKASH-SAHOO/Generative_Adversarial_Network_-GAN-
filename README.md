# Generative_Adversarial_Network_-GAN-
## Objective
To train a generative adversarial network to generate images using the CIFAR10 dataset.

### What is GAN?
A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.

1. **Basline_GAN**: It hold the code base of the structure of my GAN model. I have provided the Notbook containing the code.
2. **GAN_Model**: Here is optimized and more efficient model, I could made that the above. This Notbook contains the code. I have not saved the model, So to get a clear view of generated image, It may take a more time. In my case that was about 1hrs on Google Colab.
3. **GAN_Model_Report**: Here I have explained, in depth view of GAN model in pictorial view, and what changes I had made in my baseline_GAN model to get more efficient one i.e. GAN_Model.
